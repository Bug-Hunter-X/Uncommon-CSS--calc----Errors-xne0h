The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` is correct, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` or `width: calc(100%-10px);`  are not, omitting required spaces around the `-` operator.  Another common issue is mixing units inconsistently, like `width: calc(100% - 10em + 2px);`  which might cause unexpected results due to the unit mismatch.
