# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Errors
This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `bug.css` file contains examples of incorrect `calc()` usage, while `bugSolution.css` shows the corrected versions. These errors might not always cause immediate failures, but lead to unexpected layouts or behavior in some browsers or contexts. Pay close attention to spacing around operators, unit consistency, and the order of operations within nested `calc()` expressions.
